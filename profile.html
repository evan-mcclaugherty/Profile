            <h2>Things I like to do</h2>
            <p>
                I really like to play my classical guitar but that's taking a back seat to JavaScript right now. Being outdoors, going for a run, and (trying) to stay in shape at the gym are some of my favorite activities.

            <p>
                My obsessive personality allows me to go 100%... 100% of the time. That's like all the time. And there isn't enough hours in the day!

            <h2>A little history</h2>
            <p>
                I was in the Air Force for 5 years working in avionics. That background in electrical theory got me a job here in Denver as a diesel electrician on the railroad, where I was for 3 years. The railroad really slowed down and I was able to begin exploring
                programming and got hooked right away. When I found out they were closing down the Denver shop and I would be out of job I knew it was time for Galvanize!
